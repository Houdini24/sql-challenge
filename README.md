Module 9 Challenge

## Overview
Two weeks age I was hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). My first major task was to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files. For this project, I designed the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, imported the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answered questions about the data. See my results below.

## Data Analysis 

1. List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee:

2. List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986:
